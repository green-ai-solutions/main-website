Create a complete, multi-page, fully responsive website for a technology company called "Green AI Solutions". Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and style everything with Tailwind CSS. The website must be professional, modern, and visually appealing, reflecting a theme of sustainability, efficiency, and high-tech innovation.

Overall Theme & Design:

Color Palette: Primary colors should be a deep forest green (#0A4A3A) and a clean, bright teal (#2EC4B6). Use white (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds, a dark charcoal (#212529) for text, and a light gray (#F8F9FA) for section backgrounds to create contrast.

Typography: Use the "Inter" font from Google Fonts for all text.

Visuals: Use abstract, high-quality SVG icons and background patterns that blend nature-inspired elements (like leaves, water ripples) with technological motifs (like neural networks, circuit lines). All visuals should be clean and minimalist.

Interactivity: Implement subtle hover effects on buttons and links, smooth scrolling, and fade-in animations on sections as the user scrolls down the page.

Logo: Create a simple placeholder SVG logo that combines a stylized leaf with a circuit board pattern.
